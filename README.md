Abstract:
Recognizing that variation in recruitment is considered a key factor in population growth of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), we developed a multi-level modelling framework to analyze the sequential processes affecting turkey reproductive success during pre-nesting and nesting periods. Specifically, we created a pre-nesting habitat selection model, a nest-site selection model, and a nest success model, which allowed us to explore how fine-scale vegetation, coarse-scale land cover classifications, weather variables, and individual characteristics influenced reproductive behavior and success. These models were fit to a dataset of female turkeys in Pennsylvania (n = 195), Maryland (n = 81), and New Jersey (n = 12) USA. At the landscape-scale, pre-nesting habitat selection differed between states. Turkeys in Pennsylvania and Maryland largely selected areas dominated by deciduous forest cover, whereas turkeys in New Jersey selected grassland/shrub and wetland relative to deciduous forest. During nest-site selection, turkeys in Pennsylvania selected nesting locations with higher horizontal visual obstruction, greater percentages of ferns and understory woody vegetation, and fewer individual woody stems within 7.9 m of the nest. In Maryland, relative to deciduous forest, turkeys selected nest sites in pastures and hayfields. When modeling nest survival in Pennsylvania, we found that increased horizontal visual obstruction and percentages of fern within 7.9 m of the nest were associated with higher nest survival. We failed to detect an effect of Lymphoproliferative disease virus (LPDV) or coinfection with specific parasite taxa on nest success in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Our findings highlight the complexity of understanding turkey reproductive behavior, suggesting that a combination of habitat features and behavioral factors influence reproductive behavior and success.
