Organisms interact with their environment at multiple spatial and temporal levels often in a hierarchical manner. Recognizing that variation in recruitment is considered a key factor in population growth of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) we developed a multi-level modelling framework to analyze the sequential processes affecting turkey recruitment during breeding and nesting periods. Specifically, we created a pre-nesting movement model, a nest-site selection model, and a nest success model, which allowed us to explore how fine-scale vegetation metrics, coarse-scale land cover classifications, weather variables, and individual characteristics, influenced the recruitment process. These models were applied to a dataset of female turkeys in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey USA. At the landscape-scale, hens exhibited differing patterns of habitat selection during the pre-nesting period across the three states, exhibiting preference for deciduous forest and wooded wetlands. During nest-site selection, hens favored locations with higher visual obstruction (β= 1.45  90% CIs = 1.19, 1.73 ) and a greater abundance of ferns (β= 0.31  90% CIs = 0.05, 0.58), and understory woody vegetation ( β= 0.60  90% CIs = 0.31, 0.90), but selected sites with less individual woody stems (β= -0.57  90% CIs = -0.87, -0.28). We detected minimal effects of landscape-scale variables on daily nest survival probability; we found a positive relationship between daily nest survival probability and evergreen forest land cover (β= 0.53  90% CIs = 0.18, 0.94) in Pennsylvania and greater distances from secondary roads (β= 0.07  90% CIs = 0.006, 0.15) in Maryland. In addition, we detected a positive effect of incubation constancy (β= 0.13  90% CIs = 0.06, 0.19) in Pennsylvania and age class (Adult) (β= 0.32  90% CIs = 0.12, 0.54) in Maryland on daily nest survival probability. Our results suggest that while turkeys may select specific habitat attributes associated with nests, individual characteristics and behavioral covariates may potentially play a greater role in explaining reproductive success.
